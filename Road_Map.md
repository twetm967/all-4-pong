## Features ##

  * All-4-Pong will run on standard CSLAB Linux VMs
  * All-4-Pong will use a GUI interface (Main Menu, Game Court Screen) implemented with Qt and C++.
  * Players will score points by hitting a ball through another player’s side
  * The user can change the difficulty level of a game by choosing between 3 levels of difficulty
  * Balls will travel in straight lines, bounce off paddles, and change directions based on the angle of approach. Paddles will be moved side to side by each player.
  * All-4-Pong will utilize appropriate object oriented design patterns and techniques, including proper Model View separation.
  * Each increase in difficulty level results in faster and more aggressive AI brains.
  * All-4-Pong will support 1 to 4 human players, each running the game on separate computers. AIs will replace the appropriate number of absent human players so that each game will always have 4 contestants.
  * All-4-Pong will allow a user to save program game state (current names, points, health of players, paddle positions, and ball position(s)) and close the program.If Load saved game is selected Ball and paddle positions will be reset and current scores of each player will be displayed on the Game Court Screen next to each player’s side.
