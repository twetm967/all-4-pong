| **Date** | **Tasks Accomplished** | **Time Spent (44:45)** |
|:---------|:-----------------------|:-----------------------|
| **October 12, 2013** |First team meeting, I set up the repository and we all made sure we were able to push and pull from it easily. |3 |
| **October 14, 2013** |Created skeleton **class header files** for some of the objects and classes we will have in our world to give us an idea for what we will need to get done |1/4 hours (15 min)|
| **October 18, 2013** |Worked in the lab as a team, discussing what to do for the week. Divvied up assignments. I will be working on **AI, and Paddles, and Networking**. This should be lots of fun! Working with Thomas now discussing needed methods.|2 hours|
| **October 22, 2013** |I added a button!! Naw for real that button is legit. Thomas did some work too. Slacker. Jk. Made a Game window, and start window, along with some CPP files. Thomas worked like a boss. |20 min|
| **October 30, 2013** |Worked in the library hammering out paddle stuff and just debugging and figuring out how the clock tikc works along with the Object class. | 3 hours |
| **October 31, 2013** |Finished debugging the paddles took longer than expected was a silly error. Making progress. Made paddles use the Object class more efficiently. also made the paddles hold a pointer to their associated player and will grab the mouse position from them. later. tho. for now i'm going to bed.|2 hours|
| **November 4, 2013** |Worked on quiting a game and starting a new one. i think it's all taken care of now. Also worked on calculating paddle speed. Fun stuff|2 hours|
| **November 5, 2013** |Worked on all the paddles bouncing the ball so that even the side paddles work. Took a while to figure out what was wrong, but it turned out the math was off somewhere. It was dumb. It's always something stupid|7 hours|
| **November 8, 2013** |Prepped for Milestone 1 AI logic rebuff's, brainstormed pop-up blocks, cut down useless code|3 hours|
| **November 9, 2013** |Lots of stuff, fixed up some model view separation, got popups working with labels and bouncing around super excited, the game is coming together|6 hours|
| **November 8, 2013** |Prepped for Milestone 1 AI logic rebuff's, brainstormed pop-up blocks, cut down useless code|3 hours|
| **November 13, 2013** |worked in the lab today from 4 - 10 worked on save load, modified the barriers, it was all going great until Joseph and I tried to implement a help screen which has created a ton of issues, like going to the wrong code in commands. A command that says obj->getNet() should go to string that returns networking. but instead it goes to getRect and it crashes. So we instead of pushing that code, pushed other code that does not yet have save load functionality. very confused. |6 hours|
| **November 14, 2013** |worked more on save load to implement it in a non-buggy version. lots of strange errors where a method call will go to the wrong address line and cause a crash. really annoying. |2 hours|
| **November 15, 2013** |Hitting a lot of errors making it really slow, but user's names should show up now, save file includes paddle, paddle,paddle,paddle,ball, shapes, blocks,difficulty need to work on sending that out and create a world with it. |2 hours|
| **November 16, 2013** |Worked on save load some more, almost done with it, now the characters just have to die properly and the shapes have to have a label pop up. |5 hours|
| **November 17, 2013** |Got labels for the blocks popping up. All I have to do now is make the people die properly|1 hour|
| **November 19, 2013** |Created the Program Report & Individual report|2 hour|
